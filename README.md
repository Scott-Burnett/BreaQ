# BreaQ

![Alt text](/Images/Main.png?raw=true "Title")

BreaQ is a multi-band volume enveloper plugin designed with fast paced, bass heavy music in mind, where a tight low end, and an aggressive transient are essential.

BreaQ features an extremely dirty 2 band crossover, and 2 very snappy, midi triggered ADSR envelopes. 

The ADSR envelopes allow for precice, independant shaping of the low and high bands. 

The crossover is intended to introduce phasing in the frequency range surrounding the crossover point.
